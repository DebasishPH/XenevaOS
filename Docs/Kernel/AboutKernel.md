## The XEKernel (_Xeneva Kernel_)

The _Xeneva Kernel_ is the main component of the entire operating system. It follows __Hybrid Kernel Design__, i.e a mixture of _Monolithic Kernel_ and _Microkernel_. The core functionalities (such as _device drivers, file system managements, IPC (Inter-Process Communication), scheduling, and low-level networking_) runs in kernel space. While some services (such as _Display Managements, Network Manager, Audio Services,..etc_) runs in user space.

## Core Functionalities
The core functionalities of the kernel are :
- Memory Management
- Device Driver Management
- File System Management
- IPCs
- Scheduling
- Network Management
- Process Management
- Kernel Audio Module
- System Call (_Service Calls_, in Xeneva's language)
